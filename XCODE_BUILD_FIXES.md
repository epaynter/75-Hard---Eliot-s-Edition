# Xcode Build Errors - Resolution Summary

## Fixed Issues

### 1. HealthKitManager Scope Error
**Error:** `/Users/eliotpaynter/Desktop/Code/75 Hard - Eliot's Edition/75 Hard - Eliot's Edition/_5_Hard___Eliot_s_EditionApp.swift:35:35 Cannot find 'HealthKitManager' in scope`

**Resolution:**
- Moved `HealthKitManager.swift` from `Utils/` directory to `75 Hard - Eliot's Edition/` directory
- Added `import HealthKit` to the app file to ensure proper framework access
- Removed the original file from Utils directory to avoid duplication

### 2. JournalEntry Missing Property Error
**Error:** 
- `/Users/eliotpaynter/Desktop/Code/75 Hard - Eliot's Edition/75 Hard - Eliot's Edition/JournalView.swift:218:39 Value of type 'JournalEntry' has no member 'freeWriteText'`
- `/Users/eliotpaynter/Desktop/Code/75 Hard - Eliot's Edition/75 Hard - Eliot's Edition/JournalView.swift:241:22 Value of type 'JournalEntry' has no member 'freeWriteText'`

**Resolution:**
- Added missing `freeWriteText: String = ""` property to the `JournalEntry` model in `Models.swift`
- This property is needed for the free-write journal mode functionality

### 3. AnimatedCheckmark Redeclaration Error
**Error:** `/Users/eliotpaynter/Desktop/Code/75 Hard - Eliot's Edition/75 Hard - Eliot's Edition/HomeView.swift:1188:8 Invalid redeclaration of 'AnimatedCheckmark'`

**Resolution:**
- Identified and removed duplicate `HomeView.swift` and `JournalView.swift` files from the `Views/` directory
- These duplicate files were causing redeclaration conflicts with the main app directory versions
- Kept the comprehensive versions in the main app directory (`75 Hard - Eliot's Edition/`)

## Files Modified

1. **75 Hard - Eliot's Edition/_5_Hard___Eliot_s_EditionApp.swift**
   - Added `import HealthKit`

2. **75 Hard - Eliot's Edition/Models.swift**
   - Added `freeWriteText: String = ""` property to `JournalEntry` model

3. **75 Hard - Eliot's Edition/HealthKitManager.swift**
   - Moved from `Utils/HealthKitManager.swift` to main app directory

## Files Removed

1. **Utils/HealthKitManager.swift** - Removed to avoid duplication
2. **Views/HomeView.swift** - Removed duplicate/conflicting version
3. **Views/JournalView.swift** - Removed duplicate/conflicting version
